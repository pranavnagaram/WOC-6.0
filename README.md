## ML BOOTCAMP

This repository contains a Python library implementing various machine learning algorithms from scratch.

### Algorithms:

* **Linear Regression:** Performs linear regression for predicting a continuous target variable.
* **Polynomial Regression:** Implements polynomial regression of any degree for non-linear relationships.
* **Logistic Regression:** Classifies data points into discrete categories using a sigmoid function.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies data points based on the majority vote of their K nearest neighbors.
* **K-Means Clustering:** Groups data points into K clusters with similar characteristics.
* **N-Layer Neural Networks:** Builds and trains multi-layer neural networks for complex classification and regression tasks.
